#Calcualate and simulate coin flipping probabilities
##calc.py: 
allows you to enter a number of coins, a number of heads, and the chance that a single coin will land on heads, then calculates the chance that the (specified) number of heads will turn up when you flip that many coins.

##simulate.py:
generates a random scenario of coin flipping and tells how many times each possible number of heads turned up.

##find_avg_simulation.py:
flips a certain number of coins a certain number of times and displays the average amount of heads that turned up. 

##calc_and_graph.py:
same as calc.py, but runs 3 times, varying the number of coins, heads, and chance of a head, then displays the outcome on a graph.
